Not Showing link?
1. Make sure your internet connection is speed
2. restart locator
3. If still not showing just browse http:// 127.0.0.1:4040/
and get your link

IF YOU INSTALL LOCATOR ON SDCARD THE LINK WILL WONT SHOW
CUZ IT DESIGN TO RUN ON INTERNAL STORAGE NOT IN EXTERNAL
JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO FIX IT.

First move ngrok to home dir:
mv ngrok $HOME

then edit the locator.sh:
nano locator.sh

after that find #cd $HOME && ./ngrok http 31357
remove #
then place # on ./ngrok http 31357
my ngrok only runs for 1 hour
just sign up to ngrok then use ur own authtoken
